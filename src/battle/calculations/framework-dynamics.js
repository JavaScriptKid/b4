/*
    The Rules:

    Entire Damage = usual attack damage + ( chosen framework upgrade * dangerMeter % )




    If you're strong against a framework, multiply damage by 1.5
    1:1 ratio: 1.5


    For each strength point, add 5% damage
    For each weakness point, subtract 3%


     Vector: 2
     > Palm: 3,
     EndGame: 2,
     = Entire damage + 4%;

     Vector: 0
     > Palm: 3,
     EndGame: 2,
     = Entire damage + 10%;



    If you're strong against a framework, multiply damage by 0.5.
